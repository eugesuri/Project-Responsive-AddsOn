          <h3>Why Buenos Aires?</h3>
          <h2>Buenos Aires, the Cosmopolitan City</h2>
          <br />

          <p>
            Buenos Aires is a pulsating, passionate, cosmopolitan city. The
            combination of rich architectural and cultural heritage, modern
            creative energy, electric nightlife, unique traditions, a vibrant
            arts scene, extensive parks, and warm, friendly hosts makes it one
            of the world‚Äôs most exciting capitals. There are dozens of reasons
            to visit, hence why the city has repeatedly been voted the best in
            Latin America by users of TripAdvisor, but here are just ten of the
            big ones.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sensual, nostalgic, and fiendishly difficult to learn, tango emerged
            in the city's portside neighbourhoods in the mid-19th century and
            has since conquered the world. Today, Buenos Aires is a place of
            pilgrimage for tango dancers from all over, and the dance is still
            very much alive - danced by the young and young-at-heart well into
            the early hours every night of the week. As well as witnessing
            traditional social dancing and learning some steps at a milonga, you
            can treat yourself to sumptuous dinner-shows with spectacularly
            choreographed performances, and see live orchestras playing
            everywhere from cosy neighbourhood bars to grand symphony halls.
